# Guess-The-Number-GAME

## Description

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in C++. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback (higher or lower) to help the user narrow down the correct number. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the `project.cpp` file.
2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler of your choice.
3. Run the compiled executable in your terminal or command prompt.
4. The program will ask you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
5. Enter your guess and press Enter.
6. The program will provide feedback on whether the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.
7. Continue guessing until you find the correct number.
8. Once you guess the correct number, the program will display the number of attempts it took.

## Example

```

50
Higher Number please!
